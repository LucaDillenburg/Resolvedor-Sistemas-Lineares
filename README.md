# System of Linear Equations Solver
A program that solves systems of linear equations written in a file with N variables. It uses Gaussian Elimination algorithm.
All the data structures used were created using only built-in elements.

## Example
```sh
make main
./main
# File: system_linear_equations.txt
```
